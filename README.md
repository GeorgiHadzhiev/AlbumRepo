# AlbumRepo

This is the AlbumRepo, a site meant as a repository for music records both old and new. Each logged in user will be able to add albums to the repo and other users will be able to rate those albums. 

## How to start

Download the source code above and once opened in your IDE of choice, type in "npm i" in the console first. Then run "npm start" in the directory of the project. After that open the "backend" folder in a terminal and run "npm start" for it as well. The front end and back end should now be set up.

### What to do 

At first, you can browse the site and it's contents. You can't add albums nor can you like or disslikes already added albums. You can check the "Catalog" for what's already added and if you want more info on a certain record you click on "Details" 

If you want to add albums yourself, click on "Sign in/up" and then click on "Don't have an account, click here". From there you can register and if succesfull, you will now be able to add your own albums and rate the already existing ones. 

Once loged in, click on your Avatar and select "Add an Album" to ...add an album. Fill in all the details of it. Once completed, your album will be added to the Repo. You can browse all albums from the "Catalog" page or your can check only the ones you've made by clicking on "My albums" from the Drop down when you've clicked on the Avatar.

You can Edit or Delete your added albums. You can't do that for other people's. 

Once you've had enough, click your Avatar and select "Logout".
